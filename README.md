# [ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§] Productive Slack

A Web Extension to make Slack less distracting.

**NOTE:** This project is just getting started. See the feature list below for what is planned and what is done so far.

# Feature to-do list

* [X] Override the page title to not indicate unreads
* [x] Override the page icon to not indicate unreads ([issue #2](https://github.com/drmercer/productive-slack/issues/2))
* [ ] Basic personal analytics (how many times did you open Slack today, how much time has been spent on Slack today, trends) ([issue #3](https://github.com/drmercer/productive-slack/issues/3))
* [ ] Batch notifications on a regular interval instead of delivering them immediately ([issue #4](https://github.com/drmercer/productive-slack/issues/4))
* [ ] Filter unreads so that you only see unreads you care about the most ([issue #1](https://github.com/drmercer/productive-slack/issues/1))
* [ ] Some kind of "inbox" for important messages where you have to manually dismiss them so you can read messages without needing to respond right away ([issue #5](https://github.com/drmercer/productive-slack/issues/5))

# Project Goals

* Enable Slack users to be intentional about where their attention goes, even if their workplace as a whole doesn't want to be.

## Non-goals

* Block things. Blocking things causes reactance, and web extensions can be disabled in 3 easy clicks.
